Spec directory structure:

> spec  
  > models                  > contain the models specs
  > support                 > contain files used by the model specs
    > blueprints              > contain the 'machinist' gem blueprints (factories)
    > test_data               > contain test files used by the tests
      + bg_tasks.yml            + background task configuration
      + invalid.torrent         + a malformed torrent file that will cause a parse error
      + test.txt                + an empty text file
      + valid.torrent           + a valid parseable torrent file
    + fetchers.rb             + methods that retrieve or create records using the 'machinist' gem
    + makers.rb               + methods that create records using the 'machinist' gem
    + finders.rb              + methods that retrieve records
    + support_variables.rb    + a module with instance variables that can be included in the model specs
  + spec_helper.rb          + the rspec configuration file, also setup the support files

Note that when a spec needs to create a record it calls a method in 'fetchers.rb' or in 'makers.rb',
which uses the 'machinist' gem infrastructure to create the record. So if you want to use another
factory strategy just change the methods in these file, with no need to change the spec ones.

Also note that the support files described above are used by the cucumber features tests, located
in the directory 'features/'.

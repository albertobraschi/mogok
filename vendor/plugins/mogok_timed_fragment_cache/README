Based on the plugin forked from http://github.com/georgepalmer/timed_fragment_cache/tree/master

A rewriting to meet this application's needs and avoid redundant calls to memcached
in the controller and in the view.

Features
  - adds optional expiration time to fragment caching
  - works by adding a expiration time in the cache for a cached fragment

Usage:

  - in the controller, call the function that deletes the fragment if the expiration time is up

   if expire_timed_fragment('fragment_name') # returns true if fragment was really deleted
     # do the heavy work
   end

  - in the view perform the timed cache
    IMPORTANT: it will cache the fragment (and the expiration) if not in cache, but won't check the expiration time

   <% cache 'fragment_name', 10.minutes.from_now do %>
     cached content
   <% end %>

  - the regular fragment cache continues the same

   <% cache 'fragment_name' do %>
     cached content
   <% end %>

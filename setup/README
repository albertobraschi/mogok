
This directory contains recipes for installing all the required software
in the server (Sprinkle + passenger-stack) and for deploying the application
(Capistrano). Usually such files are placed in the 'config' directory but due
to overcrowding they were placed here instead.
Check the Deployment section of the application README file for more on how to
use the recipes.
